# Claude

Our Universal Adapter allows you to use any LLM that is OpenAI API compatible, including Anthropic's Claude models.

Deploy a Claude model and agent:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
envsubst < samples/models/claude.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create:
- A Secret containing your Anthropic API key
- A Model resource configured for Claude Opus 4
- An Agent resource that uses the Claude model

The Claude model uses Anthropic's API endpoint:

```
https://api.anthropic.com/v1/
```
