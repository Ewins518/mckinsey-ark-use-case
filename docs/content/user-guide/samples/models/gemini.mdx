# Gemini

Our Universal Adapter allows you to use any LLM that is OpenAI API compatible, such as Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral and more.

Deploy a Gemini model and agent:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
envsubst < samples/models/gemini.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Using the [Gemini OpenAI Compatibility](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) endpoint is as simple as using this address:
