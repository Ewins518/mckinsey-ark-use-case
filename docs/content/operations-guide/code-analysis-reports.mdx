# Code Analysis Reports

Our internal fork of ARK uses a number of static code analysis tools in our build. Any issues that relate to security are resolved, any issues that relate to maintainability and quality are assessed.

Given the fast pace that we are integrating other parts of our tech stack, we are balancing initial speed against technical debt. We gate our build in such a way that the trend of issues in **any** category **must** be downwards - this will force us to a zero issue codebase (potentially with exceptions if appropriate).

However, for full transparency, here is a summary of recent scans.

## Report Overview - 2025-08-20

Across the entire stack, including sample files:

| Type | Severity | Number of Issues |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Security | - | 0 |
| Reliability | High | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium | 19 |
| Reliability | Low | 5 |
| Maintainability | High | 81 |
| Maintainability | Medium | 161 |
| Maintainability | Low | 144 |

### Security

Zero issues. Any issue of any severity breaks the build.

### Reliability

Themes:

- HTML content is missing certain tags such as title
- HTML improvements for accessiblity, touch, etc
- Some containers and charts are missing explicit storage requsets

Remidiation in progress but lower priority.

### Maintainability

Themes:

- Define constants rather than hard coded strings; primarily in the ARK golang code, in progress.
- Add additional comments for complex code blocks
- Refactor to reduce cognitive complexity
- Avoid duplication (primarily in UI and samples)

Current focus is on nesting and cyclomatic complexity.
