# Models Directory

This directory contains model configurations for different AI providers and use cases.

## Structure
Each model configuration should be:
- provider-specific directories (openai/, anthropic/, etc.)
- model-specific YAML files within each directory
- README.md documenting capabilities and limitations

## Naming Convention
Use provider and model names:
- openai/gpt-4.yaml
- anthropic/claude-3-sonnet.yaml
- azure/gpt-4-32k.yaml
- local/llama2-7b.yaml

## Contributing
When contributing a model configuration:
1. Include provider-specific settings
2. Document token limits and capabilities
3. Specify recommended use cases
4. Include cost considerations if applicable
