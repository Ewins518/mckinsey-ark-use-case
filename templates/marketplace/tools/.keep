# Tools Directory

This directory contains reusable tool definitions for extending agent capabilities.

## Structure

Each tool should be in its own subdirectory with:

- tool.yaml (the main tool definition)
- src/ (source code if applicable)
- Dockerfile (if containerized)
- README.md (documentation)
- examples/ (usage examples)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the tool's function:

- file-processor/
- database-connector/
- api-client/
- data-validator/

## Contributing

When contributing a tool:

1. Follow the Ark tool specification
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Provide usage examples
4. Ensure proper error handling
5. Include security considerations
