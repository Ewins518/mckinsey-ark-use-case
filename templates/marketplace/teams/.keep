# Teams Directory

This directory contains reusable team configurations for multi-agent workflows.

## Structure

Each team should be in its own file (simple) or subdirectory (complex) with:

- team.yaml (the main team definition)
- README.md (documentation describing the workflow)
- examples/ (optional usage examples)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the team's workflow:

- code-review-team/
- data-pipeline-team/
- content-creation-team/
- security-audit-team/

## Contributing

When contributing a team:

1. Document the team's workflow and strategy
2. Explain when to use this team configuration
3. Include examples of typical inputs and outputs
4. Test the team configuration thoroughly
