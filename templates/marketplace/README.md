# ARK Marketplace

Welcome to the ARK Marketplace - a central repository for sharing reusable ARK components across projects and teams.

## Overview

The marketplace serves as a community-driven collection of:

- **Agents** - Pre-configured AI agents for specific tasks
- **Teams** - Multi-agent workflows and orchestration patterns
- **Models** - Model configurations for different providers and use cases
- **Tools** - Extensions that add capabilities to agents
- **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol server implementations
- **Queries** - Reusable query templates and patterns
- **Projects** - Complete, end-to-end Ark project templates and solutions

## Contributing Components

### Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Choose** the appropriate directory for your component type
3. **Copy** the relevant template from `templates/` directory
4. **Implement** your component following the guidelines
5. **Test** your component thoroughly
6. **Submit** a pull request

### Component Guidelines

- Provide comprehensive `README.md` with usage examples
- Test with multiple model providers when possible

#### Teams (`teams/`)

- Document the workflow strategy and use cases
- Include example inputs and expected outputs
- Explain when to use this team configuration
- Test the complete workflow end-to-end

#### Models (`models/`)

- Organize by provider (openai/, anthropic/, etc.)
- Include provider-specific configurations
- Document capabilities, limitations, and costs
- Specify recommended use cases

#### Tools (`tools/`)

- Follow Ark tool specification
- Include source code and build instructions
- Provide security considerations
- Include comprehensive error handling

#### MCP Servers (`mcp-servers/`)

- Follow MCP protocol specifications
- Document all available tools and resources
- Include security and monitoring configurations
- Provide integration examples

#### Queries (`queries/`)

- Make queries parameterizable where possible
- Document expected inputs and outputs
- Specify compatible agents and teams
- Include usage examples

#### Projects (`projects/`)

- Provide complete, self-contained Ark project structures
- Include comprehensive documentation with architecture overview
- Specify all required dependencies (models, tools, external services)
- Provide clear setup and deployment instructions
- Include working examples and sample data where applicable
- Document the use case and target scenarios
- Follow Ark best practices for resource organization
- Include multiple components working together (agents, teams, tools, etc.)

### Quality Standards

All contributions must meet these standards:

- ✅ **Documentation** - Clear README with setup and usage instructions
- ✅ **Security** - Follow security best practices
- ✅ **Compatibility** - Work with latest Ark version
- ✅ **Examples** - Provide working usage examples
- ✅ **Validation** - Pass all automated validation checks

### Submission Process

1. **Create** your component following the guidelines above
2. **Run** validation scripts: `scripts/validate-component.sh <component-path>`
3. **Test** your component in a real environment
4. **Submit** pull request with:
   - Clear description of the component's purpose
   - Usage examples and test results
   - Documentation of any dependencies
   - Screenshots or demos if applicable

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks** - CI pipeline validates component structure and security
2. **Community Review** - Other contributors provide feedback
3. **Maintainer Review** - Core team performs final review
4. **Approval** - Component is merged and becomes available
