# Agents Directory

This directory contains reusable agent definitions that can be shared across projects.

## Structure

Each agent should be in its own file or subdirectory (complex agents) with:

- agent.yaml (the main agent definition)
- README.md (documentation)
- examples/ (optional usage examples)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the agent's purpose:

- data-analyst/
- code-reviewer/
- security-scanner/
- documentation-writer/

## Contributing

When contributing an agent:

1. Ensure it follows the Ark agent specification
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Provide usage examples
4. Test with multiple models when possible
