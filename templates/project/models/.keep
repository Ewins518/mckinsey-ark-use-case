# Models Directory
#
# This directory contains AI model configurations that will be automatically 
# deployed when you run `make quickstart`.
#
# Model files are copied from samples/models/ during project creation.
# You can add more models by copying from the samples directory:
#
#   cp ../samples/models/claude.yaml .
#   cp ../samples/models/gemini.yaml .
#
# Each model file typically includes:
# - Secret for API key storage
# - Model resource configuration
#
# Set your API keys in the .env file - they will be substituted into the
# model YAML files using environment variable substitution.
