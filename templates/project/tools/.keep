# Tools Directory

Add your custom tools here as Kubernetes YAML files.

Each tool should be defined as a YAML file containing the necessary Kubernetes resources:
- Deployment
- Service  
- MCPServer (for MCP integration)

Example structure:
```
tools/
├── my-tool.yaml          # Complete tool definition
├── data-processor.yaml   # Another tool
└── examples/             # Example implementations
    └── data-tool/
        ├── Dockerfile
        ├── main.py
        └── requirements.txt
```

Tool YAML files will be automatically deployed by the Helm chart.

For complex tools that need their own Helm charts and independent lifecycle, 
use `ark generate mcp-server` in the `mcp-servers/` directory instead.
