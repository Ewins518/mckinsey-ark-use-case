# Cursor Rules for ARK Project

## Commit Message Format
MANDATORY: All commit messages and PR titles must follow conventional commit format:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix  
- docs: documentation changes
- chore: maintenance tasks
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: adding tests
- ci: CI/CD changes
- build: build system changes
- perf: performance improvements

Examples:
- feat: add agent deployment workflow
- fix: resolve memory leak in executor
- docs: update installation guide

Non-conventional commits will be rejected by automated checks.

## Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- No comments unless explicitly requested
- Use absolute paths for file operations
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Pull Request Format
When creating pull requests, use this simple format:
```
## Summary
- Brief description of changes
```

DO NOT include "Test plan" sections in PR descriptions.
