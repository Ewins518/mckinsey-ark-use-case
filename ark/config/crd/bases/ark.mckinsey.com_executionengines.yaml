              ExecutionEngineSpec defines the configuration for an execution engine that can run agent workloads.
              This allows agents to be executed by different frameworks such as LangChain, AutoGen, or other
              agent execution systems, rather than the built-in OpenAI-compatible engine.
              Execution engines work as operators that watch Query CRDs and process queries for agents
              that reference them.
