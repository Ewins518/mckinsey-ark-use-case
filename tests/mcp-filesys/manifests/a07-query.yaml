    Please help me test the filesystem operations by doing the following tasks:
    
    1. First, list the contents of the current directory to see what files exist
    2. Create a new file called "test-document.txt" with the content: "This is a test file created by the MCP filesystem agent"
    3. Read the contents of the file you just created to verify it was written correctly
    4. Create a backup by copying "test-document.txt" to "test-document-backup.txt"
    5. List the directory again to confirm both files exist
    6. Clean up by deleting the backup file "test-document-backup.txt"
    7. Confirm the cleanup by listing the directory one final time
    
    Please use your filesystem tools to complete these tasks and report on each step's success or failure.
    Be thorough in explaining what each tool call accomplished.
