    I need to build a commercial office building project in Morocco. The project includes:
    
    - 5-story office building (50,000 sq ft) in Casablanca
    - Modern glass facade and steel structure
    - HVAC systems and electrical infrastructure
    - Parking garage for 100 vehicles
    - Landscaping and exterior work
    - Interior fit-out for office spaces
    - Compliance with Moroccan building codes and regulations
    
    The project timeline is 18-24 months with a budget of $15M-$20M. We need a Moroccan construction company that has experience with commercial office buildings, understands local regulations, and can deliver on time and within budget.
